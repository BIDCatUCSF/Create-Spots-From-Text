# Create-Spots-From-Text
Creates an Imaris spots object from x,y,z-positions in a CSV file. The spots size is determined by the user. Positions must be within the image boundary, for example, no negative values. Additionally, the extension assumes three lines of header information in the CSV file, therefore the first three lines will be skipped.
